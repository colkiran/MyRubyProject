Control Structures
-------------------
1. if condition

2. case Expression			(expression will return one of the conditions)	
	when result1

	when result2
	
	when result3

	else
  end

Loops
------
1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do while
4. do until

---------------------------------------------
print the iteration
-------------------

1
22
333
4444
55555

for i in 5.downto(1) do
end

1 2 3 4 5
 1 2 3 4
  1 2 3
   1 2
  ` 1
   1 2
  1 2 3 
 1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5


print all prime numbers between 150 and 50 also print the count of it


Strings
-------
Ruby string are arbitary sequence of bytes - representing characters

String::new


a = "hello World"
b = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"








problems
--------
1. 
    1
   1 2
  1 2 3 
 1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
 1 2 3 4
  1 2 3
   1 2
    1

2.
1! = 1
2! = 2
145! = 1! + 4! + 5!
	   1  + 24 + 120
	 = 145

? next number which satisfies this condition
 

3. write a code to generate fibanocci series

4. (greedy ? )
	farmer -> 3 daughters -> each daughter had a son
        farmer had  mangoes in a room
        farmer promisses his daughters that he is going distribute mangoes to them equally in the evening after his shopping.
